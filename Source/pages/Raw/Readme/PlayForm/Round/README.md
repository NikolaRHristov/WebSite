# Round

Rounds the corners of your Windows screen.

![`Round`](https://PlayForm.Cloud/Image/GitHub/Round/Cover.png)

## Getting started

`Round` sets up a system tray application using the Tauri framework. It creates
a window for each monitor available on the system, sets up a menu for the system
tray, and handles events from the menu.

## Dependencies

The code imports several crates:

- `regex` - provides support for regular expressions
- `serde_json`- is a JSON serialization/deserialization library
- `tauri` - is the main framework for building cross-platform desktop apps in
  Rust
- `tauri_plugin_store` - provides a key-value store for persisting application
  data

## Options

The app has several menu items:

- ➕ **Increase Size**
- ➖ **Decrease Size**
- ↩️ **Reset**
- 🌑 **Dark**
- ☀️ **Light**
- 👨🏻 **Show**
- 🥷🏽 **Hide**
- ❌ **Exit**

Clicking on **Increase Size** or **Decrease Size** increases or decreases the
roundness of the windows, respectively.

**Reset** sets the corner radius back to the default value of _23px_.

**Dark** and **Light** switch the app between dark and light mode.

**Show** and **Hide** show or hide all windows, respectively.

**Exit** closes the app.
